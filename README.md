This repository is based on the
[RTEMS Source Builder](git://git.rtems.org/rtems-source-builder.git) repository
([mirror](https://github.com/RTEMS/rtems-source-builder)),
with github actions configuration added to provide pre-built toolchains
intended for use on github actions builders, or other Ubuntu based CI builders.

See [Releases](https://github.com/mdavidsaver/rsb/releases) for specific builds, with specific usage instructions.

Actual development happens on the numbered series branches.
